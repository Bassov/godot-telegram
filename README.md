## Setup Windows

Backend relies on WSL 2 (Ubuntu) and Docker

1) [Setup WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2) [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
3) Get this repo with git: `git clone https://github.com/godot-telegram/godot-telegram.git`

## Run server

1) get google api token
2) Run `make init`
3) in file `backend/.env.secret` set google api token
4) Run `make run`

For configs demo, I use public google sheets doc. For your project you should use your own.
- in file `backend/.env.secret` set google sheets doc id, get it from url of your public by link doc.

Urls:
- http://localhost:8000 - server
  - http://localhost:8000/docs/ - swagger-ui, you can try all possible requests here
  - http://localhost:8000/game_configs/ - game_configs from google sheets
- http://localhost:5432 - postgres (user: backend, password: backend, db: backend)
